A pilot study using a GAN method led to a model—“TransTox”—which facilitates bidirectional translation of transcriptomic profiles between the liver and kidney under drug treatment. TransTox has demonstrated robust performance validated across independent datasets and laboratories in the following ways:  1) the concordance between real experimental data and synthetic data generated by TransTox was demonstrated in characterizing toxicity mechanisms compared to real experimental settings and 2) TransTox proved valuable in gene expression predictive models where synthetic data could be used to develop gene expression predictive models or serve as ""digital twins"" for diagnostic applications. The TransTox approach holds potential for multi-organ toxicity assessment with AI and advancing the field of precision toxicology.",5,transparent,2023,yes,"https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/nctr-research-focus-areas/translai-initiative#:~:text=Objective: To develop generative AI,IVIVE), and genomic technologies"
